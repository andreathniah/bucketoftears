## Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

**I'm BoT, aka Bucket of Tears!**

This handle name was borne from my tears of frustration as I hit the wall over and over again with various challenges at Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions.

> "God, I hate this. I can't solve shit and I bet my tears can fill up buckets at this rate."

This blog documents my journey towards improving my security skills.

**Some highlights from my journey as of 2021:**

- [2021] Achieved Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification
- [2020] Responsible disclosure of a CVSS 8.4 Sensitive Data Exposure vulnerability
- [2019] Ranked in a CTF without being [carried](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Carried) by others
