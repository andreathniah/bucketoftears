## Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

**I'm BoT, aka Bucket of Tears!**

This handle name was borne from my tears of frustration as I hit the wall over and over again with various challenges at Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions.

> _-- me as I grumble over my life choices at every CTF._

This blog documents my journey towards improving my security skills.

**Some highlights from my journey as of 2021:**

- [2021/06] Achieved Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)
- [2020/07] Responsible disclosure of a CVSS 8.4 Sensitive Data Exposure vulnerability
- [2019/09] Ranked in a CTF without being [carried](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Carried) by others
