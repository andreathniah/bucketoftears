Mobile pentesting is scary. There's just so many things to look at, and if you are a beginner like I am, you'll feel as lost as I do. Before we delve into the monstrosity known as [OWASP MSTG](https://mobile-security.gitbook.io/mobile-security-testing-guide/), let's first look into the easy wins -- hardcoded keys.

More often than not, the first place to look for such keys would be in `AndroidManifest.xml` and `strings.xml`. However, there's certainly more that could be found throughout the APK. Of course, one can simply open the source code in their preferred IDE and manually search for the keys via the search function, but it is certainly time consuming.

Wouldn't it be good if there's a way to automate this process and efficiently sniff out needles in the haystack? Or at the very least, narrow down to several strings to verify? Well, that's what I thought too.

### Automating the Hunt

Introducing [`finding-needles`](https://github.com/andreathniah/tips-and-tricks/blob/master/scripts/find-high-entropy-strings.py) -- yes, that is a wordplay from Finding Nemo -- a handy tool that leverages on entropy checks and plain old regex checks to find sensitive strings. I'll be honest here, this is essentially a fork of [truffleHog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/truffleHog) with modifications to support consumption of files-based contents, plus a little extra stuff here and there.

The various options available allows one to:

- Search for sensitive strings via entropy checks or regex patterns
- Search through all files within a given directory or a specific file for sensitive strings
- Verbose mode to view full output and context of sensitive strings found

While this tool can be utilised on platforms so long as the ingested data are from a file -- like JavaScript chunk files which this script was originally intended for -- limitation exists. For instance, searches via entropy checks will almost always produce false positives. This is especially so if the source data is not properly formatted to multiple lines (`npx prettier --write` will be helpful here) or has legitimate high entropy strings like base64 images, automated classnames etc. Checks via regex performs better, but its constrained in the the pre-defined patterns and whether it is accurate/versatile enough. As someone who has lots of trouble with constructing regex expression, this part is especially painful to get it right.

### Security Impact

That said, the security impact of any keys found are ultimately determined by what you can actually do with them. Say that the tool was able to churn out some Google Firebase API key, question is: are you able to actually use it to access misconfigured services? Without demonstration of concrete impact, most triage teams would close the report as `N/A` (as issue is related to best-practices) or at best, `Informative` (parked under Information Disclosure category that may not have a payout).

All in all, such tools merely helps one to narrow down the findings into bitesize actions. Discretion and further analysis are always necessary to determine the true value of such strings and whether their disclosure can truly be considered a security vulnerability.
