Bucket of Tears

### `/usr/bin/whoami`

Hi there! 👋

I’m BoT, aka Bucket of Tears!

This handle name was borne from my tears of frustration as I hit the wall over and over again with various challenges at Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions.

> _“God, I hate this. I can’t solve shit and I bet my tears can fill up buckets at this rate.”_
>
> _– me as I grumble over my life choices at every CTF._

This blog documents my journey towards improving my security skills. They can be viewed at https://bucketoftears.netlify.app/.
